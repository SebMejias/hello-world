Repository to learn the basics of Github

This repository was built in order to learn the basic actions and definitions in Github. Some fundamental definitions, put in my own words, are:

- Repository: an organized set of folders and files that compose a project.
- Main branch: the canonical version of the folders and files of a repository.
- Branching: generating a copy of the main branch, in order to make changes that are not definitive until merging.
- Merging: (said of a branch *B* with respect to the main branch) replacing the content of the main branch with that of *B*.
- Commit: saved changes.
